# Alice-Stockfish

Alice-Stockfish is a dedicated [Alice Chess](https://www.chessvariants.com/other.dir/alice.html)
engine derived from official Stockfish. Alice-Stockfish 1.0 is the public
Legacy NNUE compatibility release. It uses the authenticated `Alice_v1.nnue`
asset while the layer-aware native NNUE program remains under development.

The pinned chassis, rules contract, legacy audit, NNUE compatibility boundary,
and measurement protocol are collected in the
[Alice engineering dossier](docs/alice/README.md).

The historical Fairy-Stockfish Alice branch is retained as a compatibility
reference. It is not merged into this codebase and is not treated as an
independent rules authority. The current correctness-first search can use its
frozen Alice network through a strict compatibility bridge with exact
full-refresh and incremental evaluation paths.

AliceNative-v1 networks use a separate authenticated wire format with
board-relative `SAME/OTHER` features and board-local threats. A native file is
selected explicitly; an incompatible, corrupt, missing, or identity-mismatched
file stops evaluation instead of selecting another backend:

```text
setoption name Alice Native SHA256 value <whole-file-sha256>
setoption name Alice Native EvalFile value <path-to-native-network>
setoption name Alice Evaluation value Native
```

`Alice Evaluation` also accepts `Legacy` and `Zero`. The historical
`Use NNUE=false` setting remains a compatibility alias that forces the
deterministic zero diagnostic backend. Native load and evaluation status
includes the exact generation and SHA-256.

## Verification and release state

Rules, executable, native-wire, integer-inference, and acceptance-contract tests
are part of the repository workflow. Run one local acceptance control from a
pinned definition and a new evidence directory:

```text
python -m tools.alice_acceptance \
  --definition <absolute-definition.json> \
  --evidence-root <new-absolute-directory>
```

The exact-LOS and fixed 400/300/200 batteries are separate. Exact LOS at all
three time controls comes first; the fixed battery is run only to measure Elo
when preparing a native release. A native AliceNNUE release remains blocked
until a trained AliceNative-v1 network, exact parity receipts, both local
batteries, four release binaries, triple bench, negative load probes, and
official OpenBench shadow audits are all present. These native gates do not
describe the separately documented Alice-Stockfish 1.0 Legacy NNUE
compatibility release. The public contracts and commands are listed in the
[engineering dossier](docs/alice/README.md).

## Overview

[Stockfish][website-link] is a **free and strong UCI chess engine** derived from
Glaurung 2.1 that analyzes chess positions and computes the optimal moves.

Stockfish **does not include a graphical user interface** (GUI) that is required
to display a chessboard and to make it easy to input moves. These GUIs are
developed independently from Stockfish and are available online. **Read the
documentation for your GUI** of choice for information about how to use
Stockfish with it.

See also the Stockfish [documentation][wiki-usage-link] for further usage help.

## Files

This distribution of Stockfish consists of the following files:

  * [README.md][readme-link], the file you are currently reading.

  * [Copying.txt][license-link], a text file containing the GNU General Public
    License version 3.

  * [AUTHORS][authors-link], a text file with the list of authors for the project.

  * [src][src-link], a subdirectory containing the full source code, including a
    Makefile that can be used to compile Stockfish on Unix-like systems.

  * a file with the .nnue extension, storing the neural network for the NNUE
    evaluation. Binary distributions will have this file embedded.

### Donating hardware

Improving Stockfish requires a massive amount of testing. You can donate your
hardware resources by installing the [Fishtest Worker][worker-link] and viewing
the current tests on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].

### Improving the code

In the [chessprogramming wiki][programming-link], many techniques used in
Stockfish are explained with a lot of background information.
The [section on Stockfish][programmingsf-link] describes many features
and techniques used by Stockfish. However, it is generic rather than
focused on Stockfish's precise implementation.

The engine testing is done on [Fishtest][fishtest-link].
If you want to help improve Stockfish, please read this [guideline][guideline-link]
first, where the basics of Stockfish development are explained.

Discussions about Stockfish take place these days mainly in the Stockfish
[Discord server][discord-link]. This is also the best place to ask questions
about the codebase and how to improve it.

## Compiling Stockfish

Stockfish has support for 32 or 64-bit CPUs, certain hardware instructions,
big-endian machines such as Power PC, and other platforms.

On Unix-like systems, it should be easy to compile Stockfish directly from the
source code with the included Makefile in the folder `src`. In general, it is
recommended to run `make help` to see a list of make targets with corresponding
descriptions. An example suitable for most Intel and AMD chips:

```
cd src
make -j profile-build
```

Detailed compilation instructions for all platforms can be found in our
[documentation][wiki-compile-link]. Our wiki also has information about
the [UCI commands][wiki-uci-link] supported by Stockfish.

## Terms of use

Stockfish is free and distributed under the
[**GNU General Public License version 3**][license-link] (GPL v3). Essentially,
this means you are free to do almost exactly what you want with the program,
including distributing it among your friends, making it available for download
from your website, selling it (either by itself or as part of some bigger
software package), or using it as the starting point for a software project of
your own.

The only real limitation is that whenever you distribute Stockfish in some way,
you MUST always include the license and the full source code (or a pointer to
where the source code can be found) to generate the exact binary you are
distributing. If you make any changes to the source code, these changes must
also be made available under GPL v3.

Stockfish uses neural networks trained on [data provided by the Leela Chess Zero
project][lc0-data-link], which is made available under the [Open Database License][odbl-link] (ODbL).
